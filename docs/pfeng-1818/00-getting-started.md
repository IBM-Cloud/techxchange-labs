# ðŸ”Ž Getting Started: Your Platform Engineering Journey

## Introduction: The Role of a Platform Engineer

Welcome to the world of platform engineering. In this lab, you'll step into the role of a **platform engineer** tasked with designing and automating the deployment of secure, scalable infrastructure. Your mission is to build solutions that empower your entire organization to deploy new environments rapidly while upholding the highest standards of security and operational excellence.

This lab guides you through the complete platform engineering workflow: **design â†’ automate â†’ test â†’ share**. You will learn to create powerful infrastructure-as-code solutions with Terraform that abstract away complexity, enabling development teams to self-serve with confidence.

## The Mission: Automating Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure

Your core task is to automate the deployment of a secure and resilient multi-VPC environment in IBM Cloud. Your journey will cover four key phases:

1. **Design**: Architect a secure multi-VPC infrastructure based on industry best practices.
2. **Automate**: Use Terraform and IBM Cloud modules to build a reusable, code-based solution.
3. **Test**: Validate the deployed infrastructure to ensure it is functional, secure, and resilient.
4. **Share**: Package the automation as a no-code Deployable Architecture (DA) that can be easily consumed across your organization.

## The Architecture: A Secure Hub-and-Spoke Model

The infrastructure you'll build is based on a secure hub-and-spoke model. At a high level, this architecture separates a central **management VPC (hub)** from one or more **workload VPCs (spokes)**. The hub provides a secure entry point for administration and traffic, while the spokes host applications in an isolated environment. You will explore this architecture in detail in the next section.

## Lab Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

- Design and automate a secure multi-VPC infrastructure deployment using Terraform.
- Test the deployed infrastructure to validate its security, connectivity, and functionality.
- Package your automation as a reusable Deployable Architecture (DA).
- Enable organizational self-service through no-code infrastructure provisioning.
