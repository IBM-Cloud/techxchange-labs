# Getting Started

In this lab, you'll learn to effectively leverage IBM Cloud Observability Services for monitoring and troubleshooting complex, multi-service infrastructure deployments.

This lab uses a comprehensive stack of services from the [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pattern deployable architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/7a4d68b4-cf8b-40cd-a3d1-f49aff526eb3/architecture/Retrieval_Augmented_Generation_Pattern-5fdd0045-30fc-4013-a8bc-6db9d5447a52-global) as a real-world example of complex multi-layer infrastructure. Rather than focusing on how this infrastructure was created, this lab starts from the point where all services are already deployed in your account and pre-configured to work together. You'll learn observability principles and techniques that apply to any enterprise-scale infrastructure deployment. The term Retrieval Augmented Generation is referred to as RAG throughout this lab.

> **ðŸ’¡ What is a Deployable Architecture?**
> A deployable architecture is first-class automation provided by IBM that deploys and configures a complete stack of IBM Cloud services following enterprise best practices. Think of it as a pre-built blueprint that automatically sets up complex infrastructure with all necessary integrations and security configurations. In this lab, we're using its output: a fully deployed RAG application with supporting infrastructure and observability services.

## Lab Overview

This lab is structured in two main parts:

**Part I - Monitoring Observability Services** - You'll explore how observability services are deployed, configured, and interconnected to provide comprehensive monitoring across a complex infrastructure environment. This includes:

- Validating the observability stack configuration and understanding how different components work together
- Monitoring core observability services like IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing, Metrics Routing, Cloud Object Storage, and Event Notifications

**Part II - Monitoring Other Services and Components** - You'll learn how to use and configure these observability services to effectively monitor and troubleshoot different components of the infrastructure stack, including:

- Infrastructure deployment monitoring through IBM Cloud Projects
- Serverless applications running on Code Engine
- Database services like IBM Cloud Databases for Elasticsearch  
- AI services through WatsonX

You'll examine how observability services work together in a comprehensive observability stack that includes logging, monitoring, metrics routing, logs routing, activity tracking event routing, and cross-service integrations.

## Your Lab Environment

The RAG Pattern deployment includes key components such as:

**Core Observability Services:**

- **IBM Cloud Logs**: Centralized log management and analysis
- **IBM Cloud Monitoring**: Real-time metrics, dashboards, and alerting
- **IBM Cloud Activity Tracker Event Routing**: Routing of IBM Cloud audit events to designated storage and analysis destinations
- **IBM Cloud Metrics Routing**: Routing of IBM Cloud platform metrics to monitoring services

**Pattern Supporting Services:**

- **Cloud Object Storage**: Secure storage for logs and audit data
- **Key Protect**: Centralized encryption key management
- **Code Engine**: Serverless container platform for application deployment
- **WatsonX**: AI platform services
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics engine
and more....


## What You'll Accomplish

By the end of this lab, you'll understand:

### Observability Architecture & Deployment

- How to architect a comprehensive observability stack in IBM Cloud for multi-service infrastructures
- How observability services are provisioned and configured at scale
- Best practices for integrating monitoring, logging, and activity tracking

### Multi-Layer Infrastructure Monitoring

- Monitoring strategies for different infrastructure layers (platform, application, AI services)
- How to correlate events and metrics across disparate services
- Troubleshooting techniques for complex service dependencies
