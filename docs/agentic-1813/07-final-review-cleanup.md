# Final Review and Cleanup

## What You've Built

You've completed a realistic platform engineering workflow that organizations use to scale infrastructure deployment:

**High-Code Approach**: Custom Terraform automation for the Loan Risk AI Agents application using terraform-ibm-modules, published as a deployable architecture in your private catalog.

**Low-Code Approach**: Complete solution stack combining your custom automation with IBM-provided services (watsonx.ai, observability, security) using IBM Cloud Projects.

**Impact**: Development teams can now deploy complex AI infrastructure through simple web forms while following your established security and compliance patterns.

## Cleanup Instructions

Clean up resources to avoid ongoing costs:

### IBM Cloud Project Resources

1. Go to [IBM Cloud Projects](https://cloud.ibm.com/projects) → `<your-initials>-txc-project`
2. For each configuration (observability-demo, watsonx-ai-saas-demo, agentic-ai-demo):
   - Click configuration name → **Actions** → **Destroy resources**
   - Wait for completion before proceeding to next configuration

> ⚠️ **Important:** Wait for each configuration to complete destruction before proceeding to the next one to avoid dependency conflicts.

### Private Catalog

1. Go to [IBM Cloud Catalogs](https://cloud.ibm.com/content-mgmt/catalogs) → `<your-initials>-txc-catalog`
2. Delete your deployable architecture version and product
3. Delete the `<your-initials>-txc-catalog` itself

### Local Files (if applicable)

```bash
cd ai-agent-for-loan-risk
terraform destroy
```

## Next Steps

Apply these patterns in your organization:

- **Expand**: Create deployable architectures for other application patterns and environments
- **Govern**: Add compliance scanning, approval workflows, and cost controls  
- **Scale**: Train teams and establish feedback loops for continuous improvement

You now have the practical skills to build platform engineering solutions that enable infrastructure deployment at organizational scale.
