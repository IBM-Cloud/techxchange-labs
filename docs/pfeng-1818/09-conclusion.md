# üèÅ Conclusion and Next Steps

Congratulations on completing the **Secure Hub-and-Spoke Architecture** lab!

You have successfully navigated the full lifecycle of a platform engineer: designing, automating, testing, and distributing a complex, secure, and reusable piece of cloud infrastructure.

By building and packaging this Deployable Architecture, you've seen firsthand how platform engineering provides a powerful force-multiplier for an organization, enabling development teams to move faster while ensuring that all infrastructure adheres to enterprise standards for security, resiliency, and governance.

## What's Next?

The architecture you built is a solid foundation. Here are a few ways you could expand on it:

-   **Add Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate services like IBM Cloud Monitoring and Log Analysis to get visibility into the performance and health of your infrastructure and applications.
-   **Enhance Security**: Implement more advanced security measures, such as adding a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or integrating with the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center.
-   **Create More Variations**: Build different versions of your Deployable Architecture (e.g., a smaller, more cost-effective version for development or a larger, more resilient version for production).
-   **Integrate with CI/CD**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Tekton or Jenkins to automatically test and deploy new versions of your Deployable Architecture.

Thank you for participating in this lab. We hope it has provided you with valuable, hands-on experience in building and managing enterprise-grade infrastructure on IBM Cloud.
