# Part 5: Determine success

In this final part of the lab, we compare the optimizations you made in your pull requests to the optimizations we suggested.

## Compare your proposed resource limits
1. Navigate to the git repo where we have stored the cluster configuration for workload limits (in deployment.yaml): https://us-south.git.cloud.ibm.com/hyndman/Cluster-Config
![gitlab repo](images/gitlab.png ':size=600')

1. Click on Merge Requests from the menu at the left, then click on your deployment.yaml merge request.  If there are a lot of merge requests you can click in the search bar to filter the list by author to show only your own merge requests.
![merge requests](images/merge-requests-list.png ':size=600')

1. Click the "Edit" button near the top right
![edit merge request](images/edit-merge-request.png ':size=400')

1. Adjust the merge request so that it is based off the "optimized" branch instead of "main"
![switch branches](images/switch-branch.png ':size=600')

1. Examine the difference between the suggested values and your values, by saving the merge request and then clicking on the changes tab.
![changes tab](images/changes-tab.png ':size=600')
