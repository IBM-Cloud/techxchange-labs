# Explore the IBM Cloud Logs UI

IBM® Cloud Logs is a scalable logging service that persists logs and provides users with capabilities for querying, tailing, visualizing logs and alerting.

You can collect data from many different sources, including platform data that is generated by selected services in IBM Cloud. For example, you can use IBM Cloud Logs to aggregate Log and Activity Event data into the same instance.

IBM Cloud Logs processes your data first and allows you to configure a set of tasks such as enriching the log records, applying parsing rules, or generating metrics from logs before storing the data for search or in the data bucket. Analytics are collected from ingestion, offering  efficient early detection of potential issues and errors.

## The home dashboard

The home dashboard is your first stop as you launch the UI.

The **Home dashboard** is a predefined dashboard that includes the following information for the time frame selected for the dashboard:
- The trend of high severity logs and their percentage of total logs.
- The trend of metric ingestion.
- A list of triggered alerts grouped by severity.
- A list of anomalies grouped by type.
- The applications and subsystems that generated the highest volume of errors and their template distributions.
- The logs volumes grouped by severity.
- The top 3 errors that occurred above their usual occurrence rates or occurred for the first time within the last 7 days.
- Information on the application and subsystem combinations with the highest error rates.

By default the displayed timeframe is set to 24 hours, and the information included covers both logs and metrics.

At a glance, you can see the type of logs that you are ingesting, their priority, the volumes per priority, the top errors, and the recent alerts that have been triggered.

You can also use it to spot new errors not seen in your data recently, so that you can investigate and promptly take action for unexpected situations

## Try out the app and send logs

An application to generate logs (`app-log-analysis`) has been pre-deployed in a Kubernetes cluster within a namespace named after your username.

1. Open the web app at `https://<your-username>.logs-1568-cluster-8ca15627c911dc5cc2eb40c6340e97bf-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/`, as example https://loglab-123.logs-1568-cluster-8ca15627c911dc5cc2eb40c6340e97bf-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud.
1. Click on the **Logging** tab.
1. Change the **Logger Log Level on Server** to **debug**.
1. Type `Hello World!` in the **Message** field.
1. Click on **Log Message** to submit message.
1. Repeat the steps several times changing the **Message Log Level** and the message text.
