## Summary
In this lab you have created a Data science pipeline in OpenShift AI. The Data science pipeline created was a multi-nude pipeline that executed evaluation tests on a locally running Granite model.

Pipelines can be used for model validation testing, but they are generic enough to be used for other automated tasks, such as data set preparation, model training and model deployment among others.
