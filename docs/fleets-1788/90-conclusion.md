# Conclusion

In this tutorial, you learned how to use IBM Cloud Code Engine Serverless Fleets to efficiently run parallel, compute-intensive workloads without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure.

## Summary of What You Learned

You successfully ran a serverless fleet and gained an understanding of its core components, including tasks, instances, and workers. You also learned how to use a real-world example, Docling, to convert PDFs to Markdown, which demonstrated how Code Engine automatically scales up the necessary workers to meet resource requirements. Furthermore, you explored the observability features of IBM Cloud Monitoring and IBM Cloud Logs to monitor your fleet's performance and review its logs.

## Value Proposition of Serverless Fleets

The key value of a serverless fleet lies in its ability to abstract away infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on your code and data. Code Engine automatically handles the scaling of resources, even to zero, so you only pay for the CPU, GPU, and memory resources that your fleet consumes while it's running. This approach is ideal for tasks that require parallel processing, such as batch jobs or data-intensive applications.
