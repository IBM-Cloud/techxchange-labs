# Learn about private and public views

In IBM Cloud Logs, you can configure public and private views.
- A **public view** is available to all users that have access to the IBM Cloud Logs instance. Any user with service role permissions can see them. Only users that have the `writer` or `manager` role can manage them in the instance.
- A **private view** is available to the user that creates the view in an IBM Cloud Logs instance. Only users that have the `writer` or `manager` role can manage private views in an instance.

You can use a view to see logs that match a specific filtering criteria. Views can be grouped into folders. View names must be unique within a folder.

## Creating a custom view

1. In the application, generate a log line with the message `My favorite colour is red`

1. Back in the Cloud Logs dashboard, in the left-hand navigation, click **Explore logs** > **Logs**. By default, the last view you had opened will be displayed. If no view was previously open, all views will be displayed.

1. Select the fields to be included in the view. By default, you can select *Applications*, *Subsystems*, and log *Severities*. For example, select the application that matches the namespace allocated to you.
1. Add additional filters. Select the subsystem `app-log-analysis`.

1. Select if you want your view to only include **Priority Logs** (those in the `Priority Insights` data pipeline or **All Logs**, that is, logs that are stored in your data bucket. Logs in the data bucket include logs collected through all the three data pipelines.

1. Add a Lucene query `"My favorite colour is red"` to further filter your data.

1. Specify the time interval for the view, for example `Last 5 minutes`.
1. Save your view by clicking the three dots **...**
   1. Set the view name to `<your-username>-first-view`.
   2. Check **Save query and filters** to save the query and filter values you configured.
   3. If you want your view to be the default view, check **Set as default view**.
   4. Set the privacy of your view. Private views can only be seen by you. You can set a view as **Private** or **Shared**.
7. Click **Create**.

## Organizing views into folders

To create a folder and add saved views to the folder:
1. Click **All Views**.
2. Click the folder icon. Set the folder name to `<your-username>`, and click **Create**.

3. Move the view you created in the previous section by dragging it to the folder. Make sure to select the icon of the view to drag it to a folder.

## Explore further

Create other views and explore the UI features such as:
- Selecting a field and including or excluding it in the query.
- Customizing the view UI, for example, by adding other fields.
- Viewing the log record in context by selecting the number associated to the record and clicking `View Surrounding Logs`.
