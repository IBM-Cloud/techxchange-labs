# Conclusion

In the lab exercises we covered the following topics:

- Basic SCC+WP navigation
- Finding AI resources that fail policy controls and pose risks
- Automating routine risk detection
- Finding unsanctioned “shadow AI” deployment of AI application
- Reviewing and configuring compliance and posture management policies

You should now have a basic understanding of some SCC Workload Protection capabilities and how it can provide visibility into policy-driven posture enforcement, and enable continuous security and compliance for AI infrastructure and resources.
