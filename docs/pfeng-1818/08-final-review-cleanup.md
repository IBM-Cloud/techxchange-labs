# âœ… Final Review and Conclusion

You have now completed the entire platform engineering lifecycle: from designing and automating a secure architecture to packaging it for others to consume.

## What You Accomplished

Let's review the key milestones you achieved in this lab:

-   **Designed a Secure Architecture**: You implemented a hub-and-spoke network topology, a best practice for isolating environments and securing workloads.
-   **Automated with Terraform**: You used Terraform and enterprise-grade IBM Cloud modules to define the entire infrastructure as code.
-   **Provisioned and Tested**: You deployed the infrastructure and ran a series of tests to validate connectivity, security, and the end-to-end application flow.
-   **Packaged for Self-Service**: You packaged your Terraform code into a Deployable Architecture and published it to a private catalog.
-   **Enabled Developer Self-Service**: You experienced how a developer can consume the DA to deploy a complex environment with just a few clicks, abstracting away the underlying complexity.

This lab demonstrated how platform engineering bridges the gap between infrastructure complexity and the need for development agility, resulting in faster, more secure, and more consistent application deployments.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the **Secure Hub-and-Spoke Architecture** lab!

You have successfully navigated the full lifecycle of a platform engineer: designing, automating, testing, and distributing a complex, secure, and reusable piece of cloud infrastructure.

By building and packaging this Deployable Architecture, you've seen firsthand how platform engineering provides a powerful force-multiplier for an organization, enabling development teams to move faster while ensuring that all infrastructure adheres to enterprise standards for security, resiliency, and governance.

## What's Next?

The architecture you built is a solid foundation. Here are a few ways you could expand on it:

-   **Add Monitoring and Logging**: Integrate services like IBM Cloud Monitoring and Log Analysis to get visibility into the performance and health of your infrastructure and applications.
-   **Enhance Security**: Implement more advanced security measures, such as adding a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or integrating with the IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center.
-   **Create More Variations**: Build different versions of your Deployable Architecture (e.g., a smaller, more cost-effective version for development or a larger, more resilient version for production).
-   **Integrate with CI/CD**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline using a tool like Tekton or Jenkins to automatically test and deploy new versions of your Deployable Architecture.

Thank you for participating in this lab. We hope it has provided you with valuable, hands-on experience in building and managing enterprise-grade infrastructure on IBM Cloud.
