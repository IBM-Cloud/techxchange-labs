# IBM TechXchange: Unlock Unstoppable Business Continuity with IBM Cloud Storage (2 min)
This lab will walk you through setting up a Virtual Server Instance (VSI) for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in one Availability Zone (AZ) and will demonstrate using VPC Block Storage Snapshots to restore to a new VSI in the same region or migrate the VSI to an alternate region. You will also utilize VPC File Storage replicas to restore data to an alternate region. This lab will employ a mix of IBM Cloud Portal and CLI usage to expose you to both.

You will use and/or deploy the following services by the end of this lab.

- Multiple VPC's
- VSI Virtual Machines
- Floating IP
- Public Gateway
- VPC Block Cross-Zone and Cross-Region Snapshots
- VPC File Shares and Cross-Region Replicas
- IBM Cloud Shell
- IBM Cloud Backup for VPC
