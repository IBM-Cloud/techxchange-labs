# âœ… Final Review and Cleanup

You have now completed the entire platform engineering lifecycle: from designing and automating a secure architecture to packaging it for others to consume.

## What You Accomplished

Let's review the key milestones you achieved in this lab:

-   **Designed a Secure Architecture**: You implemented a hub-and-spoke network topology, a best practice for isolating environments and securing workloads.
-   **Automated with Terraform**: You used Terraform and enterprise-grade IBM Cloud modules to define the entire infrastructure as code.
-   **Provisioned and Tested**: You deployed the infrastructure and ran a series of tests to validate connectivity, security, and the end-to-end application flow.
-   **Packaged for Self-Service**: You packaged your Terraform code into a Deployable Architecture and published it to a private catalog.
-   **Enabled Developer Self-Service**: You experienced how a developer can consume the DA to deploy a complex environment with just a few clicks, abstracting away the underlying complexity.

This lab demonstrated how platform engineering bridges the gap between infrastructure complexity and the need for development agility, resulting in faster, more secure, and more consistent application deployments.
