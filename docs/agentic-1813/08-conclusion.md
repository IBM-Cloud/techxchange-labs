# Conclusion

## Platform Engineering Capabilities

In this lab, you've learned how to:

- **Build** custom infrastructure automation using enterprise-grade Terraform modules
- **Publish** automation as no-code deployable architectures
- **Compose** multiple solutions into complete infrastructure stacks
- **Apply** these patterns to containerized workloads and infrastructure components

## What's Next

Consider how you can apply these skills in your own projects:

- **Start Small**: Begin with one application or team
- **Iterate**: Gather feedback and refine your patterns
- **Expand**: Extend to more teams and use cases
- **Govern**: Add appropriate controls as you scale
