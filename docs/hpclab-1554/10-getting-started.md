# Getting Started!

In this section, you are going to log in to IBM Cloud and understand how you can deploy a HPC environment on IBM Cloud.

## Log in to IBM Cloud

1. Go to https://ibm.biz/1554-login
2. Enter the `Username` and `Password` provided for the lab.
3. Click **Sign in**.

## Deploy the IBM Cloud HPC environment

IBM Cloud offers a deployable architecture that automatically configures a HPC environment with a pre-configured Spectrum LSF software. A deployable architecture is a modular, reusable, and automated solution architecture that can be deployed on IBM Cloud. It consists of one or more deployable components, such as virtual machines, network, storage, or cloud services, that are connected and configured to work together. Deployable architectures can be stacked together to create a robust end-to-end solution architecture, and they can be customized and extended to meet specific business needs.

1. Go to the IBM Cloud catalog.
2. Seach for **HPC**
3. Select the **IBM Spectrum LSF** tile.

?> If you were to follow the steps to add this deployable architecture to a project and to deploy it, you would end up with a fully working environment with Spectrum LSF software on IBM Cloud infrastructure. We will look at this later in more detail in the [Deploy the HPC environment](60-deploy-cluster)

Instead, in this lab, you are going to skip this step and use a pre-deployed environment.
