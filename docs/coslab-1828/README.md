# Replicate with Confidence: Secure, Multi-Region Storage with IBM Cloud Object Storage

This lab demonstrates resilient multi-region data replication for IBM Cloud Object Storage using private networks. It implements secure, automated cross-region synchronization via IBM Cloud's private backbone to ensure high availability, compliance, and cost efficiency. Key features include policy-driven replication, encrypted transfers, and automated failover for disaster recovery scenarios. The solution reduces exposure to public network risks while meeting data sovereignty requirements (GDPR, HIPAA). Ideal for finance, healthcare, and global enterprises, it provides measurable resiliency improvements over public-network alternatives through hands-on configuration of private routing, health checks, and cost-optimized transfers.
