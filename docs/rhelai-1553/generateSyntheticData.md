## Generate Synthetic Data

### Setup hugging face token to download the model
``` shell
export HF_TOKEN=`hugging face token`
```

### Download a teacher model
For this lab we will use the Mistral 7B teacher model.

``` shell
ilab model download --repository mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
```
The teacher model would be downloaded into the .cache directory.

### Serve the teacher model

``` shell
ilab -v model serve --model-path /root/.cache/instructlab/models/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3  --backend vllm --gpus 2 -- --served-model-name teacher
```


Once the teacher model is up and running, generate synthetic data

### Generate Synthetic Data

``` shell
ilab data generate   --endpoint-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1  --sdg-scale-factor 1 --pipeline simple   --model teacher  --output-dir /root/generated
```

Look into the generated folder for the data that is generated by the sdg process.
