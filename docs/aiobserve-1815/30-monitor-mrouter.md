# Monitoring IBM Cloud Metrics Routing

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand how IBM Cloud Metrics Routing exposes metrics for infrastructure monitoring
- Learn to navigate and interpret monitoring dashboards for complex service dependencies
- Practice creating alerts for critical infrastructure events to ensure operational reliability
- Explore data flow patterns between Activity Tracker, Metrics Routing, and monitoring services

In this section, you'll explore how to monitor IBM Cloud Metrics Routing. This section demonstrates how to monitor the health and performance of the underlying service that supports your applications.

## About IBM Cloud Metrics Routing

IBM Cloud Metrics Routing is a critical component that collects and routes metrics that are generated by IBM Cloud services to your IBM Cloud Monitoring instances. Each IBM Cloud service generates metrics that are specific to the service. To see the list of services that generate metrics in IBM Cloud, see [IBM Cloud services that generate metrics that are managed through IBM Cloud Metrics Routing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-cloud-services-mr). For example, they can report on the number of API requests, or latency.

> **ðŸ“‹ Why This Matters:** IBM Cloud Metrics Routing is a core service in IBM Cloud that collects and routes platform metrics from IBM Cloud services to IBM Cloud Monitoring instances. Metrics report on the performance and health of your infrastructure over time. If Metrics Routing fails, you lose visibility into the health and performance of your entire infrastructure.

## Monitoring IBM Cloud Metrics Routing through IBM Cloud Monitoring

You can use IBM Cloud Monitoring to monitor IBM Cloud Metrics Routing.

IBM Cloud Metrics Routing exposes the following metrics:

- **Successful data points**: Shows the number of data points successfully delivered to target destinations

- **Target mode**: The Target Mode is a boolean metric representing the configuration status:

    - `1` indicates that valid targets are configured
    - `0` indicates misconfigured or discarded targets requiring immediate attention

Let's look into how you can monitor IBM Cloud Metrics Routing in IBM Cloud Monitoring!

Just like with Activity Tracker, you need to monitor the health and performance of Metrics Routing to ensure your monitoring data pipeline remains intact.

> **Apply the same monitoring approach**: Follow the same pattern you used for Activity Tracker, but using the Metrics Routing dashboard template.

## Step 1: Launch the Monitoring UI

1. In the IBM Cloud console, go to **Navigation Menu icon > Observability > Monitoring > Instances**.

2. For the **rag-cloud-monitoring** instance, click **Dashboard**. Then, select **Dashboards > IBM**.

    ![Monitoring dashboard selection](images/30-13.png ':size=600')

3. Select the **Metrics Routing - Overview** predefined dashboard template to monitor Metrics Routing in IBM Cloud.

    > **Note**: Like with other templates, you can copy this template to create a custom dashboard with your specific monitoring requirements.

## Step 2: Explore your Deployment's Target Configuration

In the DA deployment, there is only one target configured *rag-cloud-monitoring-target*.

Take time to explore the **Metrics Routing - Overview** predefined dashboard and familiarize yourself with the metrics patterns.

Check the following widgets:

- **Successful Data Points Total By Source Region**

    This widget reports the number of data points that IBM Cloud Metrics Routing was able to send successfully, segmented by the source region. The source region is the IBM Cloud Metrics Routing region that sent the data points. **Why region is important?** Services generate metrics in the region where you provision instances of those services. The DA is deployed with a Metrics Routing configuration that collects and sends all metrics to the central Monitoring instance *rag-cloud-monitoring*. For more information on regions, see [Source regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/metrics-router?topic=metrics-router-regions).

- **Successful Data Points Total By Target Name**

    This widget reports the number of data points that IBM Cloud Metrics Routing was able to send successfully, segmented by target name.

- **Number of Misconfigured Targets**

    Any entries here indicate configuration issues that need immediate attention.

> **ðŸ’¡ Critical monitoring points**: Monitor targets to identify regions where you operate that may not be sending data, and keep an eye on the Number of Misconfigured Targets metric. Any failures here mean you're losing data.

Take time to explore the predefined dashboard and familiarize yourself with the metrics patterns.

## Step 3: Create Proactive Alerts for Misconfigured Targets

Creating alerts for misconfigured targets helps you:
- Detect configuration issues before they cause significant data loss
- Meet compliance requirements by ensuring your infrastructure, applications and services are monitored as required
- Maintain operational visibility across your infrastructure

> **ðŸ“‹ Why This Matters:**  A misconfigured target represents a gap collecting data that reports on the health of your infrastructure, applications and services, which can compromise your ability to monitor your overall infrastructure. Proactive alerting ensures you're notified immediately when data delivery issues occur, allowing for rapid response before significant data loss.

> **ðŸ’¡ TIP:** Adding alerts in Metrics Routing helps ensure you maintain visibility into your infrastructure.

### Create an alert

Create an alert that notifies when an target is misconfigured. A target migth be misconfigured if the service to service authorization is not valid or if the instance where metrics are sent is no longer available.

To create alerts for Metrics Routing failures, use the same approach you learned with Activity Tracker.
