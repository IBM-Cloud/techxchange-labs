# Publishing Your Automation to the Catalog

As a platform engineer, you've successfully developed and tested your Terraform automation locally. Now you're ready to **make this automation available to your organization** by publishing it as a deployable architecture in IBM Cloud's private catalog.

## Platform Engineering Value

Publishing your automation to a private catalog transforms your tested Terraform code into something much more powerful:

**No-Code Deployment**: Development teams can now deploy complex infrastructure without any Terraform knowledge, simply by filling out a form-based interface. This enables true self-service capabilities where teams can deploy infrastructure independently while following your established patterns.

**Shared Automation**: Your work becomes reusable across multiple teams and projects, while you maintain governance by controlling access and maintaining standards for infrastructure deployments across the organization.

> üí° **Key Transition:** This step represents the transition from **custom development** (what you just completed) to **organizational distribution** (making it available for others).

## Testing the Full Workflow

In this section, you'll:

1. **Publish your automation** to the private catalog as a deployable architecture
2. **Test the deployable architecture** by deploying it through the catalog
3. **Validate the end-user experience** that development teams will have

You'll be testing the same infrastructure again, but this time through the deployable architecture interface. This dual-deployment validates both your Terraform code and the catalog-based user experience.

## Step 1: Create a private catalog

To organize and manage your deployable architectures, you'll first need to create a private catalog. A private catalog allows you to control access and curate the infrastructure components available within your organization.

1. In the IBM Cloud console, from the top navigation bar, click **Manage**, then select [**Catalogs**](https://cloud.ibm.com/content-mgmt/overview) from the dropdown menu
1. From the left-hand navigation menu, select **Private catalogs**
1. Click **Create** to add a new private catalog
1. Fill in the **Name** field with `<your-initials>-txc-catalog` and select the `Default` **resource group**. Under Select a template, choose **No products for now** ‚Äî you'll add a product in the next steps. Then, click **Create**

> üí° **Tip:** You can always view your catalog by clicking **Manage** in the top navigation bar, selecting **Catalogs**, and then choosing **Private catalogs**.

## Step 2: Add your deployable architecture to the private catalog

After creating a new private catalog, you can onboard your deployable architecture. In this step, you'll add the **Loan Risk AI Agents sample application** to the catalog as a Terraform-based deployable architecture, making it available for deployment within IBM Cloud projects.

### Understanding the Catalog Metadata

When developing a custom Deployable Architecture (DA), the product repository must include an `ibm_catalog.json` file. This file provides the necessary metadata and input variable definitions required by IBM Cloud to correctly process and deploy the product. 

In a real-world scenario, this file would be created alongside your Terraform files in your source repository, and both would be packaged together during your CI/CD release process (e.g., GitHub releases, GitLab releases). The `ibm_catalog.json` would typically contain:

```json

> üìù **Note:** For this lab, you don't need to create this file manually. [The provided package](https://github.com/IBM/agentic-iac-lab-materials/releases/tag/v1.0.0) already contains both the Terraform configuration you built in the previous section and the required [`ibm_catalog.json`](https://github.com/IBM/agentic-iac-lab-materials/blob/main/ibm_catalog.json) metadata file. For more information about the catalog schema, refer to the [IBM Cloud Catalog schema documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-manifest-values).

### Adding the Product to Your Catalog

Now add the product to your catalog:

1. Go to the [private catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/content-mgmt/catalogs) and select the catalog named `<your-initials>-txc-catalog`
1. Once inside, click **Add product** to begin adding your customized deployable architecture (DA)
1. Choose **Deployable architecture** as the product type, and select **Terraform** as the delivery method
1. Choose **Public repository** (if using a private repo, ensure the system has access via credentials or IBM Cloud Secrets Manager)
1. In the **Source URL** field, enter: `https://github.com/IBM/agentic-iac-lab-materials/archive/refs/tags/v1.0.0.tar.gz`

> üí° **Package Contents:** This tar.gz file contains the complete Terraform automation you built in the previous section, along with the required `ibm_catalog.json` metadata file. In a real-world scenario, this package would typically be generated by your source control release process (e.g., [GitHub releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository) or [GitLab releases](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/)), but for this lab we provide a pre-built package to simplify the process.

6. Choose the **variation** `Code Engine application`, and set the **Software version** to `1.0.0`
7. Click **Add product** to complete the process
8. On the new screen, click **Versions** in the left-hand menu.
9. In the table, click on your version labeled `1.0.0`.
10. In the **Configure version** section, click the **Step 3 - Configure the deployment** tab, then click **Import input variables** to add all inputs (e.g., `ibmcloud_api_key`, `watsonx_ai_api_key`, `watsonx_project_id`, `prefix`, `container_registry_api_key`) to your deployment architecture

## Step 3: Make the deployable architecture available

After the product is added to a catalog, its version is initially in a draft state. To make it available for deployment, you'll set it to **pre-release** status.

To access your product version:

1. Go to the [private catalog page](https://cloud.ibm.com/content-mgmt/catalogs) and select the catalog named `<your-initials>-txc-catalog`
1. On the new page, in the **Products** table, click on our deployable architecture (DA) - `Loan Risk Evaluation with Watsonx AI Agents`

To make the deployable architecture available:

1. Go to **Versions** in the left navigation panel
1. Click the **option menu (‚ãÆ)** next to the draft version and select **Ready to pre-release**
1. Follow the prompts to make the version available for deployment

Your deployable architecture is now available in the catalog for no-code deployment by other users.

## Step 4: Find your deployable architecture in the IBM Cloud Catalog

To verify that your deployable architecture has been successfully added:

1. Go to the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog)
1. Use the search bar and type: `Loan Risk Evaluation with Watsonx AI Agents`
1. Once it appears in the results, **click on the deployable architecture**.
1. From there, you can **review the details and deploy it directly** from the catalog.

## Platform Engineering Milestone

Congratulations! You've successfully completed the **high-code approach** to creating deployable architectures. You have:

- **Developed custom Terraform automation** using terraform-ibm-modules
- **Tested the automation locally** to ensure reliability
- **Published to your organization's catalog** for reuse
- **Made complex infrastructure accessible** via no-code deployment

## What's Next: Low-Code Approach

Now you'll learn the **second approach** to building comprehensive solutions: the **low-code approach**. Instead of writing Terraform code, you'll compose existing deployable architectures from IBM Cloud's catalog to create integrated solution stacks.

This demonstrates how platform engineers can combine both approaches:

- **High-code** for custom components (like your AI application)
- **Low-code** for integrating with established services (like watsonx.ai and security services)

Together, these approaches enable you to create comprehensive platform solutions efficiently.
