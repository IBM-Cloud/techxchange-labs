## Conclusion

The two benchmark tests done in this lab provide simple demonstration for comparing the impact of number of GPUs hosting the model. In real-world scenario various other parameters e.g. GPU type, memory, use-case (for input/output token size), concurrency requirements etc. will impact the performance. 

Optimizing GPU usage and performance requires a methodical approach with iterative testing, benchmarking and evaluation.

We hope this lab was useful. Thank you.

[ Optionally, in this lab try the performance benchmarks with a different model (ibm-granite/granite-3.3-2b-instruct is available) and different input/output token sizes]
