# AI applications With Red Hat OpenShift AI in IBM Cloud

This hands-on lab utilizes a Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Cloud cluster that has the Red Hat OpenShift AI stack of operators installed and configured. You will use the OpenShift AI Jupyter Notebook feature to use GPUs for AI/ML modeling.

Red Hat OpenShift AI is the foundation of IBM watsonx.ai for developers of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. It provides a fully supported environment in which to rapidly develop, train, and test machine learning before deploying them in production. OpenShift AI can be hosted in Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Cloud which simplifies cloud operations for the developer.
