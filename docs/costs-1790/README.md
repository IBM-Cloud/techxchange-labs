# Reduce costs and optimize resources on IBM Cloud

In this lab, you’ll gain hands-on experience with IBM Cloud optimization tools while exploring FinOps and GreenOps strategies in action. The lab environment simulates a realistic cloud workload scenario, enabling you to analyze and optimize resource usage across cost, performance, and sustainability dimensions. You'll work with built-in IBM Cloud tools for cost visibility, usage tracking, and carbon footprint analysis, and learn how to apply these insights to reduce waste and maximize value.

To support this experience, we've provisioned a sample OpenShift cluster using IBM’s deployable architecture for Red Hat OpenShift on VPC. This architecture includes a fully-managed, production-grade OpenShift environment running on IBM Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) infrastructure. Several sample applications have been deployed to the cluster to simulate business workloads. These applications generate realistic resource utilization patterns, allowing you to practice identifying underused resources, right-sizing compute, analyzing cost drivers, and evaluating the environmental impact of cloud usage.
