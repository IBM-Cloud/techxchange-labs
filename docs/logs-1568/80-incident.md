# Managing alerts in the Incidents page

You can use the Incidents page to view the status of alerts that are triggered within a specific timeframe. You can also drill-down into the data for further analysis.

- You can view all the alerts which are currently triggered or those triggered within a specific time frame.
- You can organize incidents by alert definition.
- You can search alerts by name.
- You can filter alerts by type, severity, or other chosen parameters.
- You can select and modify incident status.
- You can drill-down into any triggered event to view its contextual information and underlying data.
- You can view alerts in chronological order.

## Checking whether your alert has triggered

1. Go to the Incidents page.

   The Incidents page opens and you can see if the alert that you configured has been triggered.

2. Identify your alert, and change the status to **Acknowledge**.
   * Incidents may have one of three statuses: TRIGGERED, ACKNOWLEDGED, or RESOLVED.
   * The status of an incident can be changed automatically or you can change it manually.
   * Once a triggered alert is resolved, the status of the original incident automatically changes to RESOLVED. If you have activated the Notify When Resolved settings in your alert, a new resolve event is sent.
   * Once resolved, an incident is closed. If the alert is then triggered, a new incident is opened.
   * To manually change the status, click on a TRIGGERED status, then choose to ACKNOWLEDGE or RESOLVE an incident. Doing so automatically sets you as the assignee.

Triggered alerts are presented in your Incidents page according to the **Group By** tags and **Notifications** that are set in your alert definition.

The Incidents page presents all of the individual permutations for all key-value tags that are selected in the **Group By** conditions defined in your alert. For example, update your alert definition and enter a group by subsystemName.

Then, back in the Incidents page, select Group by tags:

The Group By feature allows you to group alerts by one or more key-value tags that are aggregated into a histogram. An alert is triggered whenever the condition threshold is met for a specific aggregated key within a specified timeframe.

You will get to the following page:
