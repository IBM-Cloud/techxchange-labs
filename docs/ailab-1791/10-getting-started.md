# Getting started

Red Hat OpenShift AI gives data scientists and developers a powerful AI/ML platform for building AI-enabled applications. Data scientists and developers can collaborate to move from experiment to production in a consistent environment quickly.

In this section, you are going to log in to IBM Cloud, understand how you can deploy OpenShift AI in IBM Cloud, all from the IBM Cloud web console.

## Log in to IBM Cloud

1. Go to https://ibm.biz/1791-invite
1. Enter the `Username` and `Password` provided for the lab.
1. Click **Sign in**.

## Deploy OpenShift AI in IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud includes a deployable architecture to automatically configure a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with Red Hat OpenShift AI. A deployable architecture is a modular, reusable, and automated solution architecture that can be deployed on IBM Cloud. It consists of one or more deployable components, such as virtual machines, containers, or cloud services, that are connected and configured to work together. Deployable architectures can be stacked together to create a robust end-to-end solution architecture, and they can be customized and extended to meet specific business needs.

!> For this lab, you do not need to deploy the architecture. It has been done for you already!

To view the deployable architecture in the catalog:
1. Go to the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).
1. Switch to the **Community registry** catalog.
1. Select the **OpenShift AI on IBM Cloud** tile.
1. **And that's it**, you can proceeed to the next section of this lab.
