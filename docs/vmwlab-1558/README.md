# Deep dive into VMware Cloud Foundation as a Service, migrate, backup and network connectivity.

Learn about VMware Cloud Foundation as a service (VCFaaS) on IBM Cloud:

    1. Provision a VCFaaS environment
    2. Dive into the public and private network connectivity options and network topology
    3. Connect to remote location to migrate workloads with VMware Cloud Availability
    4. Ease to configure VM level backups with Veeam.


In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to deploy an VMware Cloud Foundation as a Service Instance  [VCFaaS](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/vmware) - IBM Cloud’s VMware Managed Solution Offering. You will be guided through the process of deploying an instance on IBM Cloud using the platform’s intuitive graphical user interface and how to interact with the VMware Cloud Director interface.

The main objective of the hands-on lab is to introduce the participant to basic VCF as a Service (VCFaaS) concepts through exploring and utilizing the VMware Cloud Director interface provided to customers to manage the offering. 
The lab consists of a partially completed deployment of the opensource Pet Clinic application in a personalized Virtual Data Center deployed on a multi-tenanted Cloud Director site. The participant will explore the Cloud Director interface, fix infrastructure issues with the application and finally configure a Veeam backup job to protect the environment.

It is important to consider through this lab that the environment is a Multi-Tenant Director Site which offers a slightly different user experience than the Single Site Instance which allocates dedicated resources to a Director Site. 

Whether you are a developer, a software engineer, or an IT professional, this lab provides you with the tools you need to understand VCFaaS on IBM Cloud.
